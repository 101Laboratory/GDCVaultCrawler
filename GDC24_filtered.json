The advent of hardware accelerated ray tracing and recent advances in algorithms derived from Reservoir-based Spatio-Temporal Importance Sampling (ReSTIR) have turned those dreams into reality. In this session, Evan and Adam discuss the theoretical and practical elements necessary to add real-time pathtraced lighting to an advanced, modern game engine (Unreal Engine 5). Specifically, the team discusses changes to the light transport model and scalability that enhance existing engine systems to handle dramatically more complex lighting environments."

It goes into a deep dive into the probe system used to light the forward rendered objects and also as a cache for the global illumination and reflections. The two probe placement strategies, a grid based one and a new octree based one, are described alongside their advantages and drawbacks. Next, it presents the raytracing done from the gbuffer for both the global illumination and the reflection. Various optimizations are presented, including the use of screen space tracing to reduce the number of world space ray needed, as well as improving raytraced lighting quality.The next section briefly covers the denoising strategy used in Snowdrop. Several denoiser options are provided, including AMD Fidelity FX Reflection Denoiser, Nvidia's raytracing Denoisers, as well as two custom in-house denoisers.Finally, the presentation ends on how the raytraced result are applied to the final image."

Larian invests heavily in character performance, and their recent blockbuster 'Baldur's Gate 3' has received rave reviews for the effort. But how did Larian arrive at those performances? How do performance directors help actors make choices when crafting the personality and physical behaviour of characters? How do they redirect and adjust when things aren't going well; inspire and encourage when they are. How do we inform, but not overwhelm and collaborate to build character with our actors? In this session, Larian's Performance Director speaks about techniques and approaches used on 'Baldur's Gate 3' (and built up over 20 years of directing) to prepare and work with actors for memorable performances."

It's a responsibility to ensure players who play the game leave with a deeper understanding of the culture, society, heritage and traditions we're showcasing. But the game we make has its own story to tell, and there might not be the space to be educating all players. It might also be tempting to explain and point out every aspect of the culture to ensure a player misses nothing, but this can do more harm than good. Thankfully, \"Lore\" is a very powerful tool that video games are great at that we can leverage to solve this problem. In this talk, Creative Director Abhi outlines various techniques used to follow a \"Lore, don't tell\" approach that let him not only be laser focused on the story he wanted to tell in Venba but also helped him shine a light on the culture he loves with all its details"

How do we allow for player expression when the protagonists are locked into specific roles? How can we leverage interactivity to incept complex, multilayered exposition into the minds of our audience?This talk focuses on the design of the narrative mechanics used to convey exposition in Alan Wake 2.

            "overview": "Designers build games around player fantasies. These typically concern something the player \"pretends\" to be inside a game. But another kind of fantasy is often overlooked: \"Player Mythologies\". These are the narratives through which players view themselves as players. Explorer, spy, collector, artist - these archetypes don't just describe a character in a game. Remarkably, they sometimes describe the actual players, and how a specific game or genre fits into players' lives. By understanding these narratives, designers can gain profound insight into their players' mindset and motivation, reshaping traditional ideas of \"good\" and \"bad\" design.In this talk, Alex Jaffe introduces player mythologies, showing their impact and their root causes in subtle design choices. He then presents a case study on the player mythology of fighting games. He shows how this lens unlocked his work on Riot Games' 2XKO (formerly Project L), and illuminates the beauty of the genre along the way."

What are its strengths and weaknesses? Who will use it, and why? What can MR do now, and what will it be able to do in the future? In this talk, game industry veteran Jesse Schell uses his thirty years of VR and AR experience to illustrate where this technology is now, where it is headed, and how by understanding the psychology of mixed reality you can successfully avoid pitfalls and invent the future of gaming."

A hierarchical multi-modal pathfinding approach operating on hyper-connected navigation data is used to produce effective paths in the complex open world of Metropolis. A novel path-planning approach is introduced between pathfinding and path following to create more varied and nuanced traversal decisions. AI path is annotated and broken down into featured patterns based on agent movement constraints and preference and then solved by an HTN-style planner into traversal plans. An adaptive traversal plan execution layer allows AI agents to carry out the planned traversal with the ability to repair and adjust their actions on the fly."

            "overview": "Personalization is well-known to improve gamer engagement significantly. However, most developers rely on outdated, historical user data for personalization, missing out on rich insights regarding session context from real-time user-game interactions. This is largely due to a) prohibitively high cloud costs of handling and processing real-time session data on cloud and b) difficulty of deploying and maintaining real-time ML models on-device nnWe propose a novel approach to overcome these challenges, using our managed on-device ML platform. The platform executes data processing, inference as well as training on-device to deliver cost-efficient, real-time personalization at scale. This results in significant improvement in gamer experience and conversion, with minimal end-to-end latency and CPU and battery usage spike"

This means that there is a ton of content to be authored, but also large amounts of data to pass through pipelines and workflows to the engine runtime. Remedy has been working on a new data pipeline and technology stack for the Northlight engine that allows us to optimize entity data for authoring at edit time, and performance at runtime, while keeping near-instant iteration times for world editing workflows. The fundamental parts of this technology are OpenUSD for authoring, and Northlight's transformative live-edit pipeline that enables entity modifications to be applied to a running game process on the fly. In this presentation, Sebastian shares how we keep the editor and runtime data representations separated, how the data is transformed, and how the real-time editing between the editor and runtime works in practice."
