Temple Gates has scripted a heuristic AI for 'Ascension' and integrated a neural network for 'Race for the Galaxy'. Since then, each new game has used new techniques to improve AI competitiveness. Deckbuilder 'Shards of Infinity's' AI identifies symmetries, such as symmetries between players or cards, to supercharge the speed of training. 'Roll for the Galaxy's' AI is designed with holes in the inputs to speed training without creating strategic blindspots. 'Dominion' introduces an embedding layer, so the neural network can learn not only the cards themselves, but the value of their constituent features. This helps handle the highly variant game state where one of a quadrillion of permutations of cards may be in play. Understanding what techniques are available in ml and which best apply to different game scenarios is a shortcut to getting the most of a nn AI."

The process for how the team worked out their CPU budgets is described, as well as how they approached the challenge of balancing the desire to saturate CPU cores with useful work, and system update dependencies. Comparisons are made to CPU frames sampled in different gameplay situations to highlight the differences that can occur based on what is currently happening in the game."

Larian invests heavily in character performance, and their recent blockbuster 'Baldur's Gate 3' has received rave reviews for the effort. But how did Larian arrive at those performances? How do performance directors help actors make choices when crafting the personality and physical behaviour of characters? How do they redirect and adjust when things aren't going well; inspire and encourage when they are. How do we inform, but not overwhelm and collaborate to build character with our actors? In this session, Larian's Performance Director speaks about techniques and approaches used on 'Baldur's Gate 3' (and built up over 20 years of directing) to prepare and work with actors for memorable performances."

This lecture describes how Insomniac Games transitioned to automated distant-LOD geometry generation. In particular, it covers in-depth the applications of fundamental mesh analysis concepts (dual meshes, the Euler Characteristic, curvature estimation, etc...) to several difficult problems (beyond standard reduction and remeshing) that arise from the unique constraints regarding distant city LODs present in Marvel's Spider-Man 2."

Realism of space is often seen as the only benefit when following real world architectural design principles, and this talk expands this into patterns that help guide an artist or designer into arranging spaces that subconsciously speak to the end user. It is the combined effect of many conditions that influence the user, and that synergy can be tapped into with games just as well as the real world."

Titles are often able to stay in the 'cultural zeitgeist' for longer when they are able to capture an influencer's heart and community, and studios utilize multiple strategies to engage with creators on top of providing review keys: Cult of the Lamb utilized an effective Twitch extension, Tchia provided bespoke influencer kits, and Armored Core provided a themed in-person experience, to name a few. nnToo often, developers and publishers approach streamers with their games, not considering what they need or look for in turn other than an abstract idea of \"you and your community may like it\". In this talk, Jenny details what content creators look for when deciding what to play, and how teams can set themselves up for success in their game's influencer outreach and strategy."

As a result, we have performance gains such as cache coherency and multithreading out of the box. Also, being implemented using some of the latest C++ features, the new framework changes the way gameplay programmers write their code by providing them some extra convenience and productivity.We will present how this framework is used for implementing one of the game's features the Case Board. We will cover how we describe the Case Board objects with components, how we register their systems, and how we interact with other modules (camera, cursor, etc.). Finally, we'll show how the interaction between C++ code and Lua scripts is organized."

These discussions aren't always productive. What are the best ways to engage in reasoned discussion rather than a mere exchange of difference? What tools should educators teach students to help them better articulate their views and structure a defense of their position? This talk introduces three argumentative techniques used in analytic philosophy to supplement the work already taught in game ethics classes. Audience members will learn these techniques---simplifying examples, analogous cases, and justifying principles---through their application to game ethics cases."

At the same time, our physical teaching spaces often sit in tension with hybrid forms of learning. Drawing on traditions of folk games, tabletop roleplaying, improv theater, standup comedy, corporate icebreakers, reality TV, mixed media, and other forms of collaborative, cooperative play, we invite five educators to share a single exercise, lesson, method, or moment that got their students playing face to face."

Every part of the world needs to have a sound, and every sound needs to have a logical link to the rest of the game.

In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, a time when many people shifted to using online spaces as their primary means of engaging with the world, this question takes on renewed importance. To tackle this question, this panel brings together experts on the psychology of games and online engagement with practitioners who helped design a game for empathy and inclusion from the ground up (thatgamecompany's Sky), led prosocial initiatives which helped reshape the character of an online community (Project Discovery in EVE Online), or who seek to harness our industry and player communities for environmental action and other forms of good. Over the hour, the panel will cover the state of community design and management, the holistic context of resilience, and lay out practical recommendations for building better worlds using many of the tools we already have as designers and developers."

However, converting shaders to take advantage of half precision types is often not a straightforward process, in particular when accounting for platform and driver quirks. nnThis talk will cover the process of creating Frostbite's FP16 API, which enables shader programmers to write FP16 shaders while the tools bridge the platform gaps under the hood. The talk will also explain the rationale behind embracing FP16 in our shaders, the various challenges and quirks of FP16 in different platforms, and how we worked around them, and, finally, it concludes by presenting some of our performance and visual results on various console and mobile platforms.

Earlier this year, Monopoly Go! rehashed a similar formula using dice and the classic board game rather than a slot machine, giving Scopely a huge hit.nnWhat makes these strange hybrid games tick?

For example, games can deceive players by using their mental models against them, eliciting accidental interactions, or employing emotionally exploitative fiction.We go over what deceptive design means in games and introduce and detail novel patterns relevant and evident in recent game design."

Meanwhile, the I Expect You To Die franchise has been a staple of seated, comfortable VR since 2016. The three-quel IEYTD3 bridges this gap with action-packed set pieces players expect from spy stories. This talk details how the team at Schell Games fulfills the fantasy of a car chase without alienating their core playersor worse, making them motion sick. It walks through challenges and assumptions of motion comfort in alpha, corresponding solutions in beta, and describes best practices found along the way."

So why not build a multiplayer game that adds the additional technical challenge of augmented reality? What could possibly go wrong? A lot, it turns out.nnThe combined challenges of networking a competitive fighting game, syncing game data across two real-world spaces, the performance limitations of mobile, all with no control over the player camera and environment create a recipe for game development chaos. This talk will dive into the solutions the Jadu team developed to overcome the chaos and ship a first-of-its-kind multiplayer augmented reality fighting game."

A subset of the wider VR player base have used these benefits of VR to explore their gender identity and expression inside of social VR spaces, utilizing VR to explore powerful forms of self actualization. While this is a niche user group, we can learn a lot about how they have used existing VR social systems to their benefit because their experiences are more amplified versions of the general impact of VR on the general population. In this talk, an experienced VR designer explores how we may be able to learn from these users and their specific needs in order to design better VR experiences."

But just as no game is the same, no intended audience is either, and that means a one-size-fits-all approach to how you \"should\" communicate about your game is simply wrong. nnSo how *should* you market you game? In this session we'll outline why *should* doesn't exist (and can, in fact, trip you up). Instead we'll highlight the range of tools and features available for you to use (or not!) on Steam, as well as the different ways to leverage the and combine them depending on your goals. nnOn Steam, your game is the best marketing tool you have, and this session will walk you through all of the different ways you can use the various tools, features, and events we have to optimize getting your game in front of the audience you made it for.n"

This means that any narrative needs to be written in a way that could potentially go on forever, too. Videogames aren't the first medium to try this, and specifically television shows can serve as means to understand how to pull it off. But due to their interactive nature, games have narrative potential and tools that are entirely unique to the medium, such as non-linear narrative, emergent storytelling, time-limited events, and using narrative design to convey a story beyond plot. This talk will dive into the manifold narrative opportunities of live games, how to structure seasonal plot with inspiration from TV shows, and how to keep a long-running story interesting for many years to come."

When playfully brainstorming new game jam ideas in Finland, you must be cautious because they might just become a reality.

It's a responsibility to ensure players who play the game leave with a deeper understanding of the culture, society, heritage and traditions we're showcasing. But the game we make has its own story to tell, and there might not be the space to be educating all players. It might also be tempting to explain and point out every aspect of the culture to ensure a player misses nothing, but this can do more harm than good. Thankfully, \"Lore\" is a very powerful tool that video games are great at that we can leverage to solve this problem. In this talk, Creative Director Abhi outlines various techniques used to follow a \"Lore, don't tell\" approach that let him not only be laser focused on the story he wanted to tell in Venba but also helped him shine a light on the culture he loves with all its details"

This approach leans on a multiresolution set of block compressed (BC6H) textures that is subsequently decoded by a small neural network. In practice, our method is integrated into the current pipelines in two stages. At production stage, we use deep learning to jointly learn the texture set and the decoder network. At runtime, we sample the learned textures and then reconstruct the material information by inferring neural network in a shader."

            "overview": "Continuous Integration (CI) is a common practice in modern software organizations. It plays an especially important role for AAA game development, where thousands of build jobs are submitted daily. However, the size and complexity of video games tend to inflate build size and duration, leading to a slower CI and longer feedback time. To provide faster CI feedback, studies have explored optimization techniques that can skip steps, and sometimes the entirety, of build jobs. This talk presents an overview of these techniques and highlights their costs and benefits. Then, it introduces RavenBuild, a novel ML-based technique tailored for video games. Contrarily to existing approaches, RavenBuild predicts build outcomes for both code and data submissions, providing full coverage for a game development CI. RavenBuild skips passing builds and therefore reduces the CI cost, up to 43%, while ensuring that failing builds are properly anticipated."

In order to deal with these challenges we created a highly generic and (almost) markup-free system for stepups and mantling relying on a minimum of assumptions while trying to maximize freedom of movement. This talk presents the basic philosophy, concepts, and implementation of this solution. The focus is on providing a solid starting point for those just starting out with this problem and some useful tools for anyone working with it."

            "overview": "Designers build games around player fantasies. These typically concern something the player \"pretends\" to be inside a game. But another kind of fantasy is often overlooked: \"Player Mythologies\". These are the narratives through which players view themselves as players. Explorer, spy, collector, artist - these archetypes don't just describe a character in a game. Remarkably, they sometimes describe the actual players, and how a specific game or genre fits into players' lives. By understanding these narratives, designers can gain profound insight into their players' mindset and motivation, reshaping traditional ideas of \"good\" and \"bad\" design.In this talk, Alex Jaffe introduces player mythologies, showing their impact and their root causes in subtle design choices. He then presents a case study on the player mythology of fighting games. He shows how this lens unlocked his work on Riot Games' 2XKO (formerly Project L), and illuminates the beauty of the genre along the way."

The fundamental parts of this technology are OpenUSD for authoring, and Northlight's transformative live-edit pipeline that enables entity modifications to be applied to a running game process on the fly.

This idea fuels a fear that improved moderation efforts against these toxic behaviors would remove a core game-playing demographic and reduce game studio profitability and sustainability.n nBased on cutting-edge, ongoing research, this talk will present a business case for effective moderation of toxic behavior in gaming spaces. It will demonstrate how toxic gaming communities negatively impact not only player safety and player communities, but the fiscal bottom line. The talk will conclude with tangible suggestions for moving forward, including the expansion and refinement of existing moderation efforts and preventative, resilience-building strategies for community management teams and player communities."

This panel presents a rubric for general elements that can be found in most, if not all, tabletop roleplaying games. It is less about establishing universal principles that will make a tabletop roleplaying game \"bad\" or \"good,\" and more about starting a discussion about tabletop games that players and designers can both benefit from. Any kind of review or critical discussion about a games medium cannot start without definitions. By dissecting these nine elements Fantasy, World, Body, Tension, Design, Principles, Form, Touch, and Intentthe panel presents important questions that designers may ask themselves during the practice of their art. And, through providing starting definitions and presenting examples of tabletop games themselves, create critical scaffolding for tabletop roleplaying games as a vehicle for storytelling."

In 2019, we created a product inclusion framework that makes our aspirations more tangible by providing teams a common language and resources that increase the consistency and depth of intentional design within our products. This year, we are sharing these Inclusive Growth Doorways and supporting resources externally for the first time, inviting all game teams to consider it for themselves. In this one-hour session, we'll share our Gaming For Everyone Product Inclusion Framework, The Inclusive Growth Doorways, and other actionable resources that bring intentionality to inclusive design. Our goal is to help teams improve player access, boost player engagement, and grow revenue. Please join Xbox's Katy Jo Wright (Senior Director of Gaming For Everyone & Sustainability) as she shares our story, resources, tools, and invites members of Team Xbox: Tim Schafer, Studio Head, Double Fine Productions; James Lewis, Sr. Business Development Manager; and Kyle Emtman, Head of Production, Head of Production, Turn 10, to discuss their firsthand experiences with the Inclusive Growth Doorways. We hope you will leave energized by the opportunity and armed with the resources to help bring this to life in your own gaming worlds."
